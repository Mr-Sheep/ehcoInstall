This script helps you to download Ehco to you local machine (currenly amd64 linux supported, I hard coded it cuz I'm lazy).

To use this script:
```
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mr-Sheep/ehcoInstall/master/ehcoInstall.sh)

```

This script will create:
```
/root/config.json
/usr/local/bin/ehco
/lib/systemd/system/ehco.service
```
